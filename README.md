# The redlure Distributed Phishing Framework
redlure is a phishing framework designed to advance pentest and red team phishing. It could also be utilized by blue teams looking to train employees through running realistic phishing scenarios. 

redlure's distributed architecture allows for multiple campaigns to be run on different ports and/or servers, while results are aggregated in a single interface. This allows you to generate phishing templates, target lists, start/stop campaigns, change domains, change ports and generate LetsEncrypt certs on multiple workers all from one interface. 

redlure was released as a part of DEFCON 28 Demo Labs.

* Role-based authentication

## redlure Ecosystem
redlure is comprised of three components:
1. redlure-console - Centralized API the operator interacts with. Stores templates and tracks campaigns/results. Manages your redlure-workers. Written in Python using Flask.
2. [redlure-worker](https://github.com/redlure/redlure-worker) - Skeletal API that manages the webserver for phishing campaigns. Multiple of these can and should be managed from a single console. Written in Python using Flask.
3. [redlure-client](https://github.com/redlure/redlure-client) - Web interface for interacting with the console API. Written with the Angular 10 framework (Typescript and HTML)

## Project State
redlure is in an ALPHA state. This means that it is working and usable within our environment, but we are unsure what difficulties may be experienced with redlure outside of our environment. Bugs are actively being discovered and fixed.
